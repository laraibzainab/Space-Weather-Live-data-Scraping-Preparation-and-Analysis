**Data Scraping and Preparation**
Step 1: Scrape your competitorâ€™s data. Use Python to scrape data for the top 50 solar flares shown in SpaceWeatherLive.com

Step 2: Tidy the top 50 solar flare data. The next step is to make sure that this table is usable using pandas.

Step 3: Scrape the NASA data. You now scrape the data in Wind/WAVES type II bursts and CMEs to get additional data about these solar flares. The format of this table is described at The Wind/WAVES type II burst catalog: A brief description.

Step 4: Tidy the NASA table. We next tidy up the NASA table. We will code missing observations properly, recode columns that correspond to more than one piece of information, and treat dates and times appropriately.

STep 5: **Analysis** Prepare plots that shows the top 50 solar flares in context with the data available in the NASA dataset.
